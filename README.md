# Overview
This exercise aims to help you:

- Learn how to create a webpage using HTML and CSS
- Learn how to manage files on GitHub
- Deploy your webpage using GitHub Pages

# What should you do? 
1. Learn HTML & CSS

    Learn HTML and CSS by completing Unit 2 of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)’s Computer Programming course. You don’t need to know anything about coding to start - it’s good for complete beginners. There are 9 lessons in Unit 2. The video playlist is ~2 hours long, and the whole course will take 4-10 hours. This course is completely free.

    1. Create an account on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css).
    2.  Go to the course: [Computer Programming: Unit 2: Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css).
    3.   Practice HTML and CSS by completing the challenges and projects in the course.

2. Build a webpage
   
    1. Complete the Project: [Event Invite exercise in Lesson 6](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/css-layout-properties/pp/project-event-invite)
    2. Save your code.

3. Validate your code
   1. Visit the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri).
   2. Click the “Validate by Direct Input” tab, paste your code into the text area, and click the “Check” button.
   3. Repeatedly improve your code until there are no more errors.

```Note💡``` Using AI can help you understand and fix coding errors. Ask AI to explain the error message to you or show your code to AI and ask how you can fix the errors if needed. 

4. Sign up a GitHub Account
   
    Sign up an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

    GitHub is a website where people can store and share their work, especially code for websites or apps. It helps you keep track of changes, work with others, and go back to earlier versions if needed. Think of it like Google Docs, but for coding projects.

5. Create a repository and include your name in the repository name.
   
    1. The repository name will appear in the link to your webpage. We use this name to tell who you are. You can use your first name or last name.
    2. Add your webpage (an HTML file) to this repository and name the file `index.html`. You can create a new file on GitHub and edit the file directly, or upload a file you prepared on your computer. Optionally, add other files your website needs (e.g., CSS files and images).

```⚠️ Note``` Use these resources to learn
   * [How to create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
   * [How to manage files in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files)
      * Read only the instructions that involve using the GitHub website.
      * Ignore any solution that involves using the `git` command.

6. Deploy your webpage on GitHub Pages

    GitHub Pages is a free service that lets you turn your files on GitHub into a simple website. GitHub Pages (`github.io`) is not the same as GitHub (`github.com`).

    1. In your repository, click on “Settings”.
    2. Select “Pages” from the sidebar.
    3. Choose the branch you want to deploy. Typically, this is the “main” branch.
    4. Click “Save” to apply the branch setting.
    5. Reload the settings page after a few minutes to see the “Your page is live at …” message. The webpage may take a few minutes to deploy on Github Pages.
    6. Click the link to visit your webpage.

7. Submit your webpage link

    Submit your webpage link under Step 4 in the Canvas titled **Submit your tasks** in the `#intro-to-digital` channel.

# How to check your work
